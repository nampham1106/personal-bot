I had heard that bier was the place to go for great beers in Indianapolis, but I only found 2 that I liked and only 1 was memorable.  However, bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps, I like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer.   The tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in the lounge area.  ",

        "6330dafa-19f0-45c9-9810-9297fef2a162": "This place was amazing! I only tried their ice cream I really wanted to try the hot chocolate but didn't get a chance :(. Well the ice cream was great! The first night I came here I got a brownie sundae all for myself, brownie on the bottom and three scoops of ice cream topped with whipped cream and nuts. I finished it all happily! I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special. \n\nThe next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination. \n\nThe service was great the workers were really nice and patient with me haha indecisive! They would joke around with me and let me sample all I wanted. ",

I don't even like french toast usually and theres was by far the most delicious food thats ever entered my mouth. I am literally drooling while writing this.\nThe chicken and waffles were unreal and standout A++++. \nI love the \"flinstones pushup-pop\" drink so creative and clever.\nEven the deviled eggs were the best I've personally ever had. They do everything right even when it comes to the music. It was super fun and such a great experience! Ignore any review thats not 4 stars because they must be delusional.",
